## Setup & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/electiq
cd electiq
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
MAPS_API_KEY=your_maps_key
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT={"type":"service_account",...}
PORT=8080
```

```bash
node server.js
# Visit http://localhost:8080
```

Run tests:
```bash
npm test
npm run test:coverage
```

---

## Deploy to Cloud Run

```bash
gcloud run deploy electiq \
  --source . \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --env-vars-file env.yaml
```

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Yes | Google AI Studio API key |
| `MAPS_API_KEY` | Yes | Google Maps JavaScript API key |
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | Recommended | Firebase Admin SDK JSON (as string) |
| `PORT` | No | Server port (default: 8080) |

---

## Assumptions Made

- Polling station locations are mock data for demonstration; production would use real ECI/government APIs
- Election timeline data is informational; exact dates vary by election cycle
- Firebase gracefully degrades — app works without it
- Quiz questions are AI-generated; quality depends on Gemini's knowledge
